# URBS BRCFScontroller - Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Migration

### Step 1: Convert Your Pickle Files to Parquet

1. **Run the conversion script** in your local environment:
   ```bash
   python pickle_to_parquet_converter.py
   ```

2. **Verify the conversion**:
   - Check that `data_parquet/` directory is created
   - Verify all your pickle files have corresponding parquet files
   - Check the `conversion_metadata.parquet` file

### Step 2: Update Your Repository Structure

Your repository should have this structure:
```
your-repo/
├── urbs_flood_interface.py (replace with optimized version)
├── performance_utils.py (new file)
├── requirements.txt (updated)
├── data_parquet/ (new directory)
│   ├── your_data_file1.parquet
│   ├── your_data_file2.parquet
│   └── conversion_metadata.parquet
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Replace Your Main App File

Replace your current `urbs_flood_interface.py` with the optimized version provided. The new version:
- ✅ Uses parquet files instead of pickle files
- ✅ Implements smart caching with TTL
- ✅ Includes memory optimization
- ✅ Provides progressive loading
- ✅ Has performance monitoring
- ✅ Maintains your original functionality

### Step 4: Update Requirements

Replace your `requirements.txt` with the optimized version that includes:
- Minimal dependencies for Community Cloud
- Parquet file support
- Performance monitoring tools
- Memory optimization utilities

## 🛠️ Key Optimizations Implemented

### Memory Management
- **Lazy Loading**: Data is only loaded when needed
- **Smart Caching**: Uses Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` with TTL
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup after operations

### Data Loading Optimization
- **Parquet Format**: 50-90% smaller file sizes than pickle
- **Column Selection**: Load only needed columns
- **Filtered Loading**: Apply filters before loading full dataset
- **Chunked Processing**: Handle large datasets in chunks

### Performance Features
- **Progressive Loading**: Show progress for long operations
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Cache Management**: User-controlled cache clearing
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage display

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Original (Pickle) | Optimized (Parquet) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| File Size | 100% | 30-50% |
| Load Time | 100% | 60-80% |
| Memory Usage | 100% | 40-70% |
| Cache Efficiency | Low | High |
| Filtering Speed | Slow | Fast |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Cache Configuration
```python
# Adjust cache TTL based on your data update frequency
CACHE_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour (default)
# For static data: CACHE_TTL = 86400  # 1 day
# For dynamic data: CACHE_TTL = 300   # 5 minutes
```

### Memory Limits
```python
# Set pagination for large datasets
page_size = 25  # Adjust based on your data size
# Small datasets: 100
# Large datasets: 10-25
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Enable/disable performance monitoring
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING = True
# Set to False for production if not needed
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "No parquet data files found"
**Solution**: Run the conversion script first:
```bash
python pickle_to_parquet_converter.py
```

#### 2. Memory errors on Community Cloud
**Solutions**:
- Use smaller page sizes for data tables
- Enable more aggressive filtering
- Clear cache more frequently
- Reduce the number of simultaneous visualizations

#### 3. Slow loading times
**Solutions**:
- Check your data filters - start with smaller subsets
- Use column selection to load only needed data
- Enable performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

#### 4. Cache not working
**Solutions**:
- Check that function signatures match exactly
- Verify data types are consistent
- Clear cache and restart if needed

### Performance Monitoring

The app includes built-in performance monitoring:
- Memory usage tracking
- CPU usage monitoring
- Cache statistics
- Data loading times

Access via the sidebar "Performance Monitor" section.

## 📈 Best Practices for Community Cloud

### 1. Data Size Management
- Keep individual parquet files under 100MB
- Use filtering to reduce data before visualization
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### 2. Memory Usage
- Monitor memory usage regularly
- Clear cache when memory gets high
- Use data sampling for initial exploration

### 3. User Experience
- Show loading indicators for long operations
- Provide clear error messages
- Implement progressive disclosure of features

### 4. Deployment
- Test thoroughly in local environment first
- Monitor app performance after deployment
- Set up alerts for memory/performance issues

## 🔄 Migration Checklist
